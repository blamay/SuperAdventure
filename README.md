# SuperAdventure 

SuperAdventure is a text-based adventure RPG created from the Scott Lilly C# Tutorial "Learn C# by Building a Simple RPG".

After completing the tutorial, I added additional features like a Login screen, multiple save files, and additional game content. I'm writing this almost 2 years after completing the project so there may be other additions to the game that I'm forgetting.

This was the first project I took on to learn C# after graduating from University and the tutorial gave me the foundation I needed to land my first role as a Software Engineer.
